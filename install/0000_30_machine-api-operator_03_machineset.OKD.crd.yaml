                          If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
                          than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.
                          The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,
                          and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                          unique on the server.

                          If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
                          NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason
                          ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client
                          should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

                              and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                              unique on the server.

                              If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
                              NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason
                              ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                  These fields should not be set for transitive errors that a
                  controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
                  time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
                  fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of
                  the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                  of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
                  spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the
                  responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.

                  Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
                  can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the
                  controller's output.
