                subnet, and outside of the DHCP range.

                addresses in the provisioning DHCP range is present within the metal3 cluster
                or external to it. This field is being deprecated in favor of provisioningNetwork.
              type: boolean
            provisioningDHCPRange:
              description: Needs to be interpreted along with provisioningDHCPExternal or
                provisioningNetwork. If the value of provisioningDHCPExternal is set to False,
                provisioningDHCPRange represents the range of IP addresses that the DHCP server
                running within the metal3 cluster can use while provisioning baremetal servers.
                If the value of provisioningDHCPExternal is set to True, then the value of
                provisioningDHCPRange will be ignored. When the value of provisioningDHCPExternal
                is set to False, indicating an internal DHCP server and the value of
                provisioningDHCPRange is not set, then the DHCP range is taken to be the default
                range which goes from .10 to .100 of the provisioningNetworkCIDR. This is the only
                value in all of the provisioning configuration that can be changed after the
                installer has created the CR. This value needs to be two comma sererated IP
                addresses within the provisioningNetworkCIDR where the 1st address represents the
                start of the range and the 2nd address represents the last usable address in the
                range. When the provisioningNetwork is set to `Managed`, the value of
                provisioningDHCPRange would be used and ignored in the other 2 modes.

            provisioningNetwork:
              description: provisioningNetwork provides a way to indicate the state of the underlying
                network configuration for the provisioning network. This field can have one of the
                following values -
                `Managed`- when the provisioning network is completely managed by the Baremetal IPI
                solution.
                `Unmanaged`- when the provsioning network is present and used but the user is
                responsible for managing DHCP. Virtual media provisioning is recommended but PXE
                is still available if required.
                `Disabled`- when the provisioning network is fully disabled. User can bring up the
                baremetal cluster using virtual media or assisted installation. If using metal3 for
                power management, BMCs must be accessible from the machine networks. User should
                provide two IPs on the external network that would be used for provisioning services.
