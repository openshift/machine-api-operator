                to the time when the machine is seen by MDB controller as having been
                marked for deletion (or after a timeout). The key in the map is the
                name of the machine and the value is the time when the API server
                processed the deletion request. If the deletion didn't occur and a
                machine is still there it will be removed from the list automatically
                by MachineDisruptionBudget controller after some time. If everything
                goes smooth this map should be empty for the most of the time. Large
