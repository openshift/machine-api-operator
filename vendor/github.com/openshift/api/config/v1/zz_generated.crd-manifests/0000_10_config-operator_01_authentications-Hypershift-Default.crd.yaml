                        conditions are used to communicate the state of the `oidcClients` entry.

                        Supported conditions include Available, Degraded and Progressing.

                        If Available is true, the component is successfully using the configured client.
                        If Degraded is true, that means something has gone wrong trying to handle the client configuration.
                        If Progressing is true, that means the component is taking some action related to the `oidcClients` entry.
